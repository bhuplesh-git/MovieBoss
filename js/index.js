  message: After winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio) 
  spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob

  thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack. Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class 
  table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts. In return, he spirits Rose off to third-class for an e

  who has made his living making sketches on the streets of Paris, to draw her in the nude wearing the invaluable blue diamond 
  Cal has given her. Cal finds out and has Jack locked away. Soon afterwards, the ship hits an iceberg and Rose must find Jack while 
  both must run from Cal even as the ship sinks deeper into the freezing water.
